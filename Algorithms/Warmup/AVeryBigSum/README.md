A Very Big Sum
==============
You are given an array of integers of size **N**. You need to print the sum of the elements in the array, keeping in mind that some of those integers may be quite large.

#### Input Format

The first line of the input consists of an integer **N**. The next line contains **N** space-separated integers contained in the array.

#### Output Format

Print a single value equal to the sum of the elements in the array.

#### Constraints 
 

#### Sample Input
`
5
1000000001 1000000002 1000000003 1000000004 1000000005`

#### Output
`
5000000015`
#### Note:

The range of the 32-bit integer is .
When we add several integer values, the resulting sum might exceed the above range. You might need to use long long int in C/C++ or long data type in Java to store such sums.
