Solve Me First
==============
Welcome to HackerRank! The purpose of this challenge is to familiarize you with reading input from [stdin](https://www.hackerrank.com/external_redirect?to=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams#Standard_input_.28stdin.29) (the standard input stream) and writing output to [stdout](https://www.hackerrank.com/external_redirect?to=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams#Standard_output_.28stdout.29) (the standard output stream) using our environment.

Review the code provided in the editor below, then complete the solveMeFirst function so that it returns the sum of two integers read from stdin. Take some time to understand this code so you're prepared to write it yourself in future challenges.

Select a language below, and start coding!
