Arrays - DS
===========
An array is a type of data structure that stores elements of the same type in a contiguous block of memory. In an array, **A**, of size **N**, each memory location has some unique index, **i** (where **0 <= i < N**), that can be referenced as **A[i]** (you may also see it written as **Ai**).

Given an array, **A**, of **N** integers, print each element in reverse order as a single line of space-separated integers.

**Note:** If you've already solved our C++ domain's Arrays Introduction challenge, you may want to skip this.

#### Input Format

The first line contains an integer, **N** (the number of integers in **A**). 
The second line contains **N** space-separated integers describing **A**.

#### Constraints
- **1 <= N <= 10^3**

- **1 <= Ai <= 10^4, where Ai is the ith integer in A**

#### Output Format

Print all **N** integers in **A** in reverse order as a single line of space-separated integers.

#### Sample Input
```
4
1 4 3 2
```
#### Sample Output
```
2 3 4 1
```
